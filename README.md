# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Conflicting Custom Class Names

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS that arises when custom class names clash with existing Tailwind utility classes.  The issue leads to unpredictable styling behavior and can be challenging to troubleshoot.

## Bug Description

The bug involves unintentionally creating a custom class name that overlaps with a Tailwind CSS utility class. This conflict overrides the intended styling, leading to unexpected visual outcomes.  Debugging can be difficult due to the subtle nature of the conflict.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application (instructions may vary depending on the setup).
3. Observe the unexpected styling behavior caused by the conflicting class names.

## Solution

The solution lies in carefully choosing custom class names. Avoid names that could potentially conflict with existing Tailwind utility classes, such as those starting with `bg-`, `text-`, `font-`, etc.  Using a naming convention for custom classes (e.g., prefixing with `custom-`) can help prevent these types of conflicts.

## Additional Notes

- Tailwind's PurgeCSS functionality can help minimize this issue, but it does not entirely eliminate the possibility of conflicts.
- Thorough testing and careful naming conventions are crucial to avoid these types of errors.  Consider using a linter or other tooling to detect potential naming conflicts early in the development process.
